## VVV Allocation Contracts

## Questions so far

## Seemingly Best Practices

1. Implement safeTransfer, safeERC20, etc. where possible.
2. Always use upgradeable versions of OZ contracts in an upgradeable contract!

## Potential Pitfalls

1. Account for USDC/T decimals as we move to testnet! Should be just accounted for in the amounts of investment themselves...maybe no invervention needed
